# Things I would add/change if you had more time

1. Unit test coverage - Although the more complex methods are covered I would take more of a TTD appoach and also look to capture edge cases
2. There is a slight in-accuracy with the calculation due to rounding, which i would look to resolve
3. Tidied up the naming of the API endpoints
4. Implemented http error handling for failing requests
